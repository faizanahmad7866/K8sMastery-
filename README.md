<h1>Why Kubernetes Needed </h1>
 <p>Why Kubernetes is Needed
    Kubernetes is like a super-smart assistant that keeps your apps (like a website or game) running smoothly. It works with containers (like app packets) and VMs (like virtual PCs). It fixes problems, handles busy times, and makes sure your app doesn’t depend on one computer. Here’s why you need it:
    
    Self-Healing:
    What: Fixes apps when they stop working.
    Example: Your coffee shop app crashes. Kubernetes restarts it, so people can order coffee.
    Why: No need to fix it yourself, which takes time.
    Scaling:
    What: Adds or removes app packets to match how busy it is.
    Example: Your chat app gets super busy at night. Kubernetes adds more packets to keep it fast, then removes them when it’s quiet.
    Why: Keeps apps fast without wasting resources.
    Not Host-Based:
    What: Apps don’t rely on one computer. They run across many.
    Example: If one computer breaks, Kubernetes moves your app to another, so it stays on.
    Why: Your app won’t stop if one machine fails.
    Not Just Containers, Also VMs:
    What: Manages both containers and VMs.
    Example: Your new app uses containers, but your old payment system uses a VM. Kubernetes runs both.
    Why: One tool for all your apps, old or new.
    Super Simple Example
    Imagine a food truck app:
    
    Self-Healing: Order system crashes? Kubernetes restarts it, so people can order tacos.
    Scaling: Lunch rush? Kubernetes adds more app packets, then removes them after.
    Not Host-Based: Computer dies? Kubernetes moves the app to another, keeping orders open.
    VMs: Manages your old payment VM and new order packets together.</p>
